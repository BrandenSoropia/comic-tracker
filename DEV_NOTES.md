# What is this?

A place to leave thoughts, discoveries, struggles and everything else!

I want to try a refresh myself and enjoy programming again. I've been doing frontend with React and JS for a while and I think changing it up and trying something completely new will fun/reinvigorating!

I chose Python because Figure 1 (current workplace) uses it. It helps that it's pretty simple syntactically and I'm slightly familiar with it from the school days. Also I discovered it comes with sqlite (according to Flask docs, it's good for small projects) so that helps with setting things up!

However, I'm new to venv and package manager pip, The ideas are simple but I'm not going to touch them unless I have to! Also my OOP/Python game is weak, so that's going to have to level up too!
